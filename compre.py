# intro to list comprehension
# the idea behind this is to do carry out an operation on a part or all of a list then add it to the list

# cars = ['volvo', 'peugeot', 'aston martin', 'range rover']
# nums = [1,4,6,7,3,8]
# below is what it looks like
# new_cars = [car[0].upper() + car[1:] for car in cars]
# added_num = [num + num for num in nums]
# print(added_num)




# list comprehension with conditional logic
# add_num = [num + num for num in nums]
# print(add_num)

# list comp with an if statement
# even = [num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0]
# start_with_v = [car for car in cars if car[0] != 'v']


# list comp with double logical statements
# odd = [num+num if num % 2 != 0 else 0 for num in nums]
# even = [num * 10 if num % 2 == 0 else 'odd' for num in nums]

# even_above_five = [num * 3 if num % 2 == 0 and num > 4 else print(f'{num} is neither even nor greater than 4') for num in nums]
# print(nums)

# words = ['yes', 'lame', 'carton']
# is_vowels = [char[0] for char in words]

# Exercises
# names = ['May', 'Jared', 'Morounfolu']
# answer = [name[0] for name in names]

# numbs = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# answer2 = [num for num in numbs if num % 2 == 0]

# names = ['Wale', 'Dale', 'Keye', 'Leke']
# reversed_names = [name[-1::-1].lower() for name in names]
# divisible_by_2 = [num for num in range(1,101) if num % 2 != 1]

# answer = [letter for letter in 'amazing' if letter not in 'aeiou']


# Nested List
# house_numbers = [[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]]

# nums = ['*' for num in range(1,5)]
# for val in house_numbers:
#     for num in val:
#         print(num)

# Exercise 2
# answer = [[i for i in range(1,4)] for j in range(1,4)]
matrix = [[i for i in range(10)] for j in range(10)]
print(matrix)
